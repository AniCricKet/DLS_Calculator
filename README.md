# DLS Method Calculator

The [Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method](https://www.icc-cricket.com/about/cricket/rules-and-regulations/duckworth-lewis-stern) is a mathematical formula used in cricket to adjust target scores in limited-overs matches affected by weather interruptions. Introduced as an enhancement to the original Duckworth-Lewis method, the DLS method factors in contemporary scoring patterns and takes into account the evolving nature of the game. Designed to provide fair and realistic target adjustments, it considers variables such as the number of overs played, wickets lost, and the resources available to both teams. The DLS method is widely adopted in One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) to ensure equitable outcomes in matches affected by rain or other weather-related disruptions, contributing to the integrity and competitiveness of limited-overs cricket. However due to the complexity of the calculations, fans tend to not know what the revised target and par score would be, leaving them in the darkness. Because of this, I made this simple web application that helps cricket fans at home calculate the revised target score using the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern Method. The calculation is based on the overs remaining, wickets lost, and the ICC's official DLS Method table for specific overs and wickets configurations.

## Notes

- If T20I format is selected, the application automatically limits the maximum overs remaining to 20.

- The D/L Method table is used to determine the percentage adjustment based on the remaining overs and wickets lost.
